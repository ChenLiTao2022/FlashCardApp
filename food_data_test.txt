// Testing script to verify food data storage consolidation

Steps to test:

1. Open your app and navigate to the Shop screen
2. Purchase some food items
3. Navigate back to the CatSection screen
4. Verify that the purchased food items are visible in the food inventory
5. Feed the cat with the purchased food items
6. Go back to the Shop and verify the quantities have been updated

This should work now because:
- Both screens use the consolidated food data storage (loadFoodData/saveFoodData)
- Both screens refresh their data when they regain focus (useFocusEffect)
- The food data is maintained in a single place in AsyncStorage
